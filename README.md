Treasure Hunt :D

How to run the simulation:
1. Select the treasure map. (1 = passable, 0 = impassable, 2 = starting point, 3 = goal, where the treasure stored)
2. Map will be displayed. 
4. Select which heuristic you want to use. the uninformed search will be applied by default. but you can choose between 2 heuristics provided, Manhattan Distance or Straight Line Distance
3. Click the â–º (play) button so that the map you have uploaded will be displayed visually and the simulation will be started automatically. There are several signs which represent your map visually. Anchor denotes that the path contains an obstacle which means the path is impassable. Start sign represents the starting point of the journey. You will also find a treasure chest which is your goal. There are also ocean waves which represent the visited path (path added to the frontier) and water drops which represents the explored path. The solution path will be represented by the sailboat moving from start to the goal.
4. You can also pause the simulation by clicking the pause button or manually move from a node to the next node by clicking the next button or if you want to back to the previous node, just click the previous button. 
5. Once you find the solution to the goal, the treasure chest will be opened for you!
6. Click restart button if you want to restart the journey or try another heuristic.
